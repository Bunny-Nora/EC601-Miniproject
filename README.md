* I, the owner of an entertainment company, want to track Twitter Users‘sentiments of the celebrities in my company.
* I, as a big fan of BTS, want to use Twitter to find the most viewed pictures of my idol such as a stunning picture from the concert so that I will compensate for the missed interesting pictures as many as possible.
